# Download a list of apps created in your environments

With the retirement of the Power Apps admin center, this feature is no longer available.

You can view apps in your environments. In the Power Platform admin center, select an environment and then select an item in the **Resources** section. See [Manage Power Apps](admin-manage-apps.md#manage-power-apps). 

<!--
If you're an Environment admin, you can view and download a list of apps created in the environments that you're administering. If you're a 365 Global admin or Power Platform admin, you can view and download a list of apps created in all of the environments in your organization.

In this topic, you'll learn how to download a list of apps created in a single environment to a .csv file, and then view that list in Excel.

## Prerequisites
 To follow the steps, the following items are required:
 * Either a Power Apps plan or Power Automate plan. Alternatively, you can sign up for a [free Power Apps trial](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/signup-for-powerapps).
 * Power Apps Environment Admin, Global admin, or Power Platform admin permissions. For more information, see [Environments administration in Power Apps](environments-administration.md).

## Sign in to the Power Apps Admin center
Sign in to the Admin center at [https://admin.powerapps.com](https://admin.powerapps.com).

## Download the list of apps
1. In the navigation pane, click or tap **Environments**, and then click or tap the environment for which you want to download the list of apps.

2. On the **Resources** tab, click or tap **Apps**, and then click or tap **Download the list of apps**.

    ![Select Download the list of apps](./media/admin-view-apps/resources-app.png)

    The list of apps is downloaded into a .csv file. This process could take several minutes. Make sure that you don't close the window before the list completely downloads or you may have to restart the process.

## View the list
After the .csv file is created, open it in Excel. The list contains the app display name, the owner of the app, any connectors that the app uses to connect to data sources, and other information.

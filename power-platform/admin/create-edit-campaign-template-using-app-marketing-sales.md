# Create or edit a campaign template using in-app marketing (Sales)

<!-- legacy procedure -->

Save time when creating multiple campaigns by creating a campaign template. Campaign templates contain prefilled data that you specify, so you don't have to reenter the same information for each campaign. You can either create a new campaign template or copy an existing campaign to use as a template.  
  
## Create a campaign template  
  
1. In the web app, go to **Marketing** > **Campaigns**.
  
2. Select **New Template**.  
  
    \- OR -  
  
    Open the campaign you want to edit.  
  
3. Add information in the template form just as you do when creating a campaign. In the template form, enter the information you want to appear in campaigns based on this template, and add items such as planning tasks, campaign activities, and marketing lists.  
  
4. Select **Save** or **Save and Close**.  
  
## Copy an existing campaign as a template  
  
- Open the campaign that you want to copy. Select **Copy as Template**, type a name for the template, and select **Save**.  
  
  If you need to back up your campaign templates, or use them in a different implementation of customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), you can copy the data to a different environment using the [Configuration Migration tool](manage-configuration-data.md).

# General availability deployment 

After a release wave is generally available, all environments will be automatically turned on to receive mandatory updates which will enable the early access features and the general available features of a release.  

> [!TIP]
> Check out [Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Release Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/release-plans/) to learn more about new features to be released in the release waves.   

Throughout a release wave, your environments will be updated during one of the weekend [maintenance windows](policies-communications.md#maintenance-timeline) based on your environments' region. The specific dates when the updates will occur will be published to the [Message Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/manage/message-center?view=o365-worldwide). Each notification will include the dates, the maintenance window, and the Release Plan reference for the list of optimizations, fixes, and enhancements. Each environment should see the new features and build numbers by Monday morning, local time. See [Policies and communications](policies-communications.md#scheduled-system-updates). 

> [!NOTE]
> If you have enabled the early access updates in your environments, you'll continue getting updates throughout the release wave.
>
>If you did not opt in for the early access updates in your environments, your environment will be automatically updated to receive the new release based on the general availability deployment schedule for your region.  

## Deployment schedule  

The general availability deployment is based on the regions where environments are created.

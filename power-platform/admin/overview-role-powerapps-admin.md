# What's the role of a Power Platform administrator?
Administration of Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse is done through the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).


## Administration journey
The evolution of an organization adopting Power Apps, Power Automate, and Dataverse starts with the administrator. As an administrator, you begin your journey asking how you can protect your organization's data. What data is accessible through these services? Are there best practices to follow? What is the Power Apps security model and how should I control access to data? Once you determine how to proceed with data access, you'll then want to know how you can monitor and manage what users are doing with these services.

When you've figured out control and visibility, the next part of your journey takes you to deployment. Individual users and teams can deploy apps on their own, but how do you centrally deploy solutions for your entire organization? And how do you orchestrate updates and identify and fix issues?

The documentation in this section, which you can access from the navigation pane on the left, provides answers to these questions and guides you on this journey.

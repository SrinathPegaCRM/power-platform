# Quickly navigate with the Microsoft 365 app launcher

<a name="BKMK_AppLauncher"></a>   
## Quickly move between apps with the app launcher  
 The app launcher is built in to all Dynamics and [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] apps. Use the app launcher in the top left corner to quickly navigate to your Dynamics application of choice.

> [!NOTE]
>  For [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online_Government_Full](../includes/pn-crm-online-government-full.md)] subscriptions, the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] app launcher will take users to either Dynamics 365 apps or the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)]. Admins will go to the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)].

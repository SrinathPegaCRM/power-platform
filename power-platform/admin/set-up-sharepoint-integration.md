# Set up SharePoint integration

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

You can use the document management capabilities of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] from within a Microsoft Dataverse model-driven app or a customer engagement app, such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation. 

You can store and manage documents in the context of a record on a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], and leverage the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] infrastructure to share, manage, and collaborate efficiently. Because the documents are stored on a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], users who aren't running the app can directly access the documents on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], provided they have the appropriate permissions.  
  
 For document management functionality, you enable server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration on a site collection in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. Server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] provides the following benefits.  
  
- Users sign-in once and do not have to sign-in to both customer engagement apps and [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  
  
- No additional software is required to install on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] documents will display in lists.  
  
- Users can perform [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] actions from the command bar.

# Use Power BI

Power BI works with model-driven apps in Microsoft Dataverse to provide a self-service analytics solution. The Power BI service automatically refreshes the data displayed. With [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_desktop](../includes/pn-power-bi-desktop.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Excel_Full](../includes/pn-ms-excel-full.md)] Power Query for authoring reports and Power BI for sharing dashboards and refreshing data from model-driven apps or Dynamics 365 apps, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service. Integrating Power BI with Dataverse provides the personnel in your organization a powerful way to work with data.

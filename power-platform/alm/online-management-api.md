# Online Management API (REST) to manage environments

> [!NOTE]
> Effective August 26, 2020, the Online Management API is [deprecated](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#online-management-api-powershell-module-and-rest-api-are-deprecated).

The Online Management API is a REST API that lets you create and manage Microsoft Dataverse environments in your Microsoft 365 organization. As application publishers or ISVs, you can use the Online Management API to:

* Automate the creation of custom demo Dataverse environments.
* Manage multiple Dataverse environments, in case your enterprise includes multiple organizations.

Using the Online Management API, you can perform various tasks on your environment such as create, retrieve, delete, backup and restore environments, and other environment-related tasks. More information:

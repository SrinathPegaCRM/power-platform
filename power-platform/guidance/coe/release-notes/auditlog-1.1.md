# Released version Audit Log Components 1.1

## Introduction

Version 1.0.0.17 for the CoE Starter Kit Audit Log Components is now available. This article describes the updates, including the new features and the fixes to existing functionality, included in this release. This version was first made available on September 18, 2020.

## Table changes

Connection References have been added to the solution to support the new modern import solution experience. All flows have been updated to use connection references, rather than connections.

## Custom Connector

To help with the setup, the custom connector used in the [Audit Log components](../setup-auditlog.md) has been removed from this solution and added to the Core solution.

# Key concepts - Enhanced authoring in Power Virtual Agents in Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../advanced-fundamentals.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](advanced-fundamentals-teams.md)



You can go beyond basic authoring in Power Virtual Agents by taking advantage of a number of advanced features. These features enhance and improve upon the [authoring experience](authoring-fundamentals-teams.md) by letting you:
- Expand the types of information the bot understands and can parse back
- Use variables to retrieve information from one part of a topic and use it in another, to ensure a consistent experience for your bot users
- Utilize existing support content from website pages, such as FAQ pages, to quickly create a robust set of topics that can be used in a bot
- Allow users to sign in directly within a bot, and then use that authentication to retrieve information from backend systems
- Use advanced Power Automate flows to retrieve and send information to other databases

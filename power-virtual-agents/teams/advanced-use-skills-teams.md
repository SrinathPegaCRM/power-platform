# Use Microsoft Bot Framework Skills in Power Virtual Agents in Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../advanced-use-skills.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](advanced-use-skills-teams.md)




Power Virtual Agents enables you to extend your bot using [Bot Framework skills](/azure/bot-service/skills-conceptual?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true).

You can add a skill from within the Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams, but you need a [Power Virtual Agents standalone subscription](../requirements-licensing-subscriptions.md). 

You should also review and refer to the web app version of this topic for more information: [Bot Framework Skills in the Power Virtual Agents app](../advanced-use-skills.md).

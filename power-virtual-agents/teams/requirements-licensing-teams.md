If you can access Teams, and if you can add the Power Virtual Agents app, then it's likely you already have all the necessary licenses. Users of your bot will also need to access Teams, but you can't add users to a team unless they already have access to Teams as a whole.

However, you may find some instances where you can upgrade to a premium license, as in the following example when publishing to additional channels:
